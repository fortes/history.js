# This project is not maintained!

The code is here if you want it, but this is not maintained. If you'd like to take over, go ahead and send a pull request. Browsers are modern enough, just ditch the last few that don't support the History API.

# history.js

history.js provides an implementation of the [HTML5 history API](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/history.html#the-history-interface): `history.pushState` and `history.replaceState` functions, as well as the `window.onpopstate` event.

Browsers that already support his event (Chrome & Safari, Firefox 4+) use native implementations, which are able to change the page URL without refreshing the page. Older browsers use `location.hash` in order to mimic the official behavior.

## Installation

Include the script file in your HTML file:

    <!-- Include JSON if you want to support older browsers -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="json2.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="history-min.js"></script>

## Usage

Same as the official HTML5 API:

    // Switch to the item
    window.history.pushState({ id: 35 }, 'Viewing item #35', '/item/35'});

    // Single handler
    window.onpopstate = function (e) {
      var id = e.state.id;
      load_item(id);
    };
    
    // Multiple listeners using addEventListener
    window.addEventListener("popstate", function callback1(event) {
      var id = e.state.id;
      load_item(id);
    }, true);
    
    window.addEventListener("popstate", function callback2(event) {
      do_something_else(e.state);
      // remove one single listener
      window.removeEventListener("popstate", callback2, true);
    }, true);

Any use allowed in the standard but not supported by this API is considered a bug.
